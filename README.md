## üìÅ Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **PPE_detection_YOLO** | A system to detect personal protective equipment (helmets, vests, masks etc.) on individuals in images/video using YOLO. Useful for enforcing safety compliance in industrial/work environments. |
| **Retail-Store-Item-Detection-using-YOLOv5** | A model to detect and classify retail store products on shelves using YOLOv5. Helps monitor stock availability, product placement, and shelf organization. |
| **Traffic-Signal-Violation-Detection** | Real-time detection of traffic violations (e.g. vehicles crossing red lights) from CCTV/video feeds. Annotated detection, alerts & video frame processing. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, YOLO (YOLOv5 / YOLO versions)
- **Computer Vision Tools**: OpenCV, image/video processing libraries
- **Deployment / DevOps**: Docker (where applicable), Git for version control
- **Model Optimization / Inference**: (if included) quantization, model conversion (ONNX / TensorRT), real-time inference pipelines
