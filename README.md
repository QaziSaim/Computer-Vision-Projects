# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to **Computer Vision Projects** by Qazi Saim!  
This repository contains several end-to-end computer vision applications demonstrating detection, classification, and safety compliance solutions using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

---

## üìÅ Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **PPE_detection_YOLO** | A system to detect personal protective equipment (helmets, vests, masks etc.) on individuals in images/video using YOLO. Useful for enforcing safety compliance in industrial/work environments. |
| **Retail-Store-Item-Detection-using-YOLOv5** | A model to detect and classify retail store products on shelves using YOLOv5. Helps monitor stock availability, product placement, and shelf organization. |
| **Traffic-Signal-Violation-Detection** | Real-time detection of traffic violations (e.g. vehicles crossing red lights) from CCTV/video feeds. Annotated detection, alerts & video frame processing. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, YOLO (YOLOv5 / YOLO versions)
- **Computer Vision Tools**: OpenCV, image/video processing libraries
- **Deployment / DevOps**: Docker (where applicable), Git for version control
- **Model Optimization / Inference**: (if included) quantization, model conversion (ONNX / TensorRT), real-time inference pipelines

## üõ† How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QaziSaim/Computer-Vision-Projects.git
   cd Computer-Vision-Projects
````

2. Navigate into the project you want to run, for example:

   ```bash
   cd PPE_detection_YOLO
   ```

3. Install required dependencies (you can use `requirements.txt` if provided):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Prepare the dataset (images/videos) as needed, and set any config files or paths.

5. Run training or inference scripts:

   ```bash
   python train.py  # or whatever script names are used
   python detect.py --source path/to/video/or/images
   ```

6. (Optional) For deployment / optimization, consider converting the model to ONNX or TensorRT, quantizing etc., depending on the project.

## ‚úÖ Why These Projects

These projects showcase ability in:

* Building robust object detection systems (YOLO family)
* Working with real-world use cases (safety, surveillance, retail)
* Handling model training, evaluation, and inference pipelines
* Potential to extend with model optimization, deployment to edge/cloud

---

## üöÄ Ideas for Improvement / Extensions

Here are some directions you could take these further:

* Integrate **model conversion & quantization** (e.g. ONNX, TensorRT, FP16 / INT8) for faster inference
* Add **vision-language models** or multimodal components (e.g. CLIP) for richer classification or scene understanding
* Use CI/CD pipelines & Docker containers to automate deployment
* Apply data augmentation & annotation pipelines for scaling dataset quality
* Real-time multi-camera video processing or streaming input
